## About me

I'm a security researcher specializing in smart contract audits and security consulting.

Currently, I have been working as a Security Researcher at [Hexens](https://hexens.io/) for over a year, Iâ€™ve contributed to 60+ audit reports, collaborating closely with industry giants to enhance their security infrastructure.

My journey also includes significant roles as a Core Contributor at [Security Wiki](https://wiki.r.security/), and a triager at [Remedy](https://r.xyz/), where my efforts have directly impacted the safety and reliability of numerous protocols.

Previously, I held roles in the financial sphere for over a decade: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tpiliposyan/).
