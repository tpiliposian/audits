Currently, I hold the role of Security Researcher at [Hexens](https://hexens.io/), a Core Contributor at [Security Wiki](https://wiki.r.security/), and a triager at [Remedy](https://r.xyz/).

Previously, I held roles in the financial sphere for over a decade: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tpiliposyan/).
