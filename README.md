## About me

I'm a security researcher specializing in smart contract audits and security consulting.

Currently, I hold the role of Security Researcher at [Hexens](https://hexens.io/) and a Core Contributor at [Security Wiki](https://wiki.r.security/). 

Previously, I held roles in the financial sphere for over a decade, including a tenure at the Central Bank of Armenia, where I led the Risk Management Division: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tpiliposyan/).
