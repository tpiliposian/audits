## [H-01] Malicious validator can steal user funds by front-running withdrawal credentials

Co-reporter [Aghasi](https://twitter.com/M3talDrag0n)

### Description

PATH: `Staking.sol:initiateValidatorsWithDeposits` L396-457

By default in this protocol, the ones who have `INITIATOR_SERVICE_ROLE` and `STAKING_MANAGER_ROLE` manage the beacon chain validator creation process. The validator would sign the deposit data with the withdrawal credentials set to a protocol-controlled contract so that withdrawals would be received by the protocol (`withdrawalWallet_`).

In case the validator is malicious, they can monitor the mempool and front-run the `deposit` transaction of the beacon chain for its pubKey and deposit 1 ether for different withdrawal credentials. Because of the beacon chain implementation and ETH specs ( link ), in `ProcessDeposit`, if the `pubKey` is already registered, it increases its balance, not touching the `withdrawal_credentials`. 

When the deposit reaches the consensus layer, the validator would be granted the 32 ETH of user funds and they can withdraw this to their own address.

This bug was also present in Lido and Frax:

### Code Snippet

```solidity
function initiateValidatorsWithDeposits(ValidatorParams[] calldata validators)
        external
        onlyRole(INITIATOR_SERVICE_ROLE)
    {
        if (pauser.isInitiateValidatorsPaused()) {
            revert Paused();
        }
        if (validators.length == 0) {
            return;
        }

        // First loop is to check that all validators are valid according to our constraints and we record the
        // validators and how much we have deposited.
        uint256 amountDeposited = 0;
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < validators.length; ++i) {
            ValidatorParams calldata validator = validators[i];

            if (usedValidators[validator.pubkey]) {
                revert PreviouslyUsedValidator();
            }

            if (validator.depositAmount < minimumDepositAmount) {
                revert MinimumValidatorDepositNotSatisfied();
            }

            if (validator.depositAmount > maximumDepositAmount) {
                revert MaximumValidatorDepositExceeded();
            }

            if (validator.depositAmount > allocatedETHForDeposits) {
                revert NotEnoughDepositETH();
            }

            _requireProtocolWithdrawalAccount(validator.withdrawalCredentials);

            usedValidators[validator.pubkey] = true;
            amountDeposited += validator.depositAmount;

            emit ValidatorInitiated({
                id: keccak256(validator.pubkey),
                operatorID: validator.operatorID,
                pubkey: validator.pubkey,
                amountDeposited: validator.depositAmount
            });
        }

        allocatedETHForDeposits -= amountDeposited;
        totalDepositedInValidators += amountDeposited;
        numInitiatedValidators += validators.length;

        // Second loop is to send the deposits to the deposit contract. Keeps external calls to the deposit contract
        // separate from state changes.
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < validators.length; ++i) {
            ValidatorParams calldata validator = validators[i];
            depositContract.deposit{value: validator.depositAmount}({
                pubkey: validator.pubkey,
                withdrawal_credentials: validator.withdrawalCredentials,
                signature: validator.signature,
                deposit_data_root: validator.depositDataRoot
            });
        }
    }
```

### Remediation

This issue can be mitigated by either having validators pre-deposit 1 ETH with the protocolâ€™s withdrawal credentials and check this on-chain before adding it to Operator Registry.

Another mitigation (similar to Lido) is having the caller of deposit also supply the latest deposit state root from the DepositContract. This should then be checked before making the deposit. This ensures that there were no calls to the deposit contract between the signing and the actual depositing.


## [M-01] Deposit share rate can be manipulated by staking manager

### Description

PATH: `Staking.sol:setExchangeAdjustmentRate` (L599-610)

In the current implementation of the `setExchangeAdjustmentRate` function, there is a check for `exchangeAdjustmentRate_` value to be less or equal to the `_BASIS_POINTS_DENOMINATOR` (10,000). By setting `exchangeAdjustmentRate_` equal to `_BASIS_POINTS_DENOMINATOR`, the function `ethToMntETH` would always return a 0 value. This way users always will get a 0 amount of `mntETH` for staking.

The staking functionality also does not have any slippage protection and as such it leads to centralisation risk where the staking manager can deny people shares or steal ETH by front-running large deposits.

### Code Snippet

```solidity
function setExchangeAdjustmentRate(uint16 exchangeAdjustmentRate_) external onlyRole(STAKING_MANAGER_ROLE) {
        if (exchangeAdjustmentRate_ > _BASIS_POINTS_DENOMINATOR) {
            revert InvalidConfiguration();
        }

        exchangeAdjustmentRate = exchangeAdjustmentRate_;
        emit ProtocolConfigChanged(
            this.setExchangeAdjustmentRate.selector,
            "setExchangeAdjustmentRate(uint16)",
            abi.encode(exchangeAdjustmentRate_)
        );
    }
```

```solidity
function ethToMntETH(uint256 ethAmount) public view returns (uint256) {
        // 1:1 if there is no controlled ETH.
        if (totalControlled() == 0) {
            return ethAmount;
        }

        // deltaMntETH = (1 - exchangeAdjustmentRate) * (mntEthSupply / totalControlled) * ethAmount
        // This rounds down to zero in the case of `(1 - exchangeAdjustmentRate) * ethAmount * mntEthSupply <
        // totalControlled`.
        // While this scenario is theoretically possible, it can only be realised feasibly during the protocol's
        // bootstrap phase and if `totalControlled` and `mntEthSupply` can be changed independently of each other. Since
        // the former is permissioned, and the latter is not permitted by the protocol, this cannot be exploited by an
        // attacker.
        return Math.mulDiv(
            ethAmount,
            mntETH.totalSupply() * uint256(_BASIS_POINTS_DENOMINATOR - exchangeAdjustmentRate),
            totalControlled() * uint256(_BASIS_POINTS_DENOMINATOR)
        );
    }
```

### Remediation

To prevent such a situation, adjusting the validation check in the `setExchangeAdjustmentRate` function is recommended at least to disallow the `exchangeAdjustmentRate_` from being a too large value (e.g. a maximum of 10% of `_BASIS_POINTS_DENOMINATOR`).
