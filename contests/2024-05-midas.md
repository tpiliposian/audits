## [M-01] Storage Gap Alignment in DepositVault and RedemptionVault Contracts

### Summary

The `DepositVault.sol` and `RedemptionVault.sol` contracts within the codebase exhibit a discrepancy in the size of their storage gaps. While `DepositVault` utilizes a storage gap of `uint256[50]`, `RedemptionVault` employs a storage gap of `uint256[51]`. This inconsistency deviates from the common practice observed in the codebase, where storage gaps typically align to a fixed number, often 50:

### Vulnerability Detail

The vulnerability arises from the mismatch in the size of the storage gaps between the two contracts. Inconsistencies in storage layout can lead to challenges in maintenance and future upgrades. While the difference between defined __gaps is 1 (51-1), mentioned contracts have more than 1 storage used in difference, i.e.

```solidity
// Example Contract A
uint256 private storageVariableA;
uint256[49] private __gap; // Should align with the number of storage variables used (1)

// Example Contract B
uint256 private storageVariableB1;
uint256 private storageVariableB2;
uint256 private storageVariableB3;
uint256[47] private __gap; // Should align with the number of storage variables used (3)
```

### Impact

The impact of this inconsistency lies in potential difficulties during code maintenance and upgrades. Inconsistent storage layouts can lead to storage collisions and make the codebase harder to understand and maintain.
The probability of something going wrong with future upgrades is low to medium, and the impact of mistakes would be medium to high.

### Tool used

Manual Review

### Recommendation

It is recommended to align the size of storage gaps in each contract with the number of storage variables used. This practice ensures consistency and mitigates the risk of storage collisions.
